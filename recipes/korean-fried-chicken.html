        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Korean fried chicken, often referred to as Huraideu-chikin, is a popular dish in South Korea that differs from American fried chicken in its technique and flavors. It's known for its crispy, double-fried exterior and often coated in a sweet, spicy, or savory sauce.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, quartered</li>
            <li>½ yellow onion, grated</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>¾ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>½ cup self-rising flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup very cold water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make marinade: Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C).</li>
            <li>While oil is heating, make the batter: Whisk cornstarch, flour, sugar, pepper, and salt together in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in cold water until mixture resembles a smooth batter. Use tongs to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely. Discard marinade.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.</li>
         </ol>
